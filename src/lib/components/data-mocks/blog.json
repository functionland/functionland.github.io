It&#x2019;s evident that Web3 would require an acceptable, if not superior user experience to what they currently use on a daily basis with current computing infrastructure. When it comes to end-user hardware, there is the potential for gaming consoles and VR devices to &#x2018;converge with Web3&#x2019; fairly readily, and enable streaming, or projecting of assets, media and so forth to consumers. But what about a dedicated piece of consumer hardware, i.e. &#x2018;Hardware Infrastructure&#x2019; that enables both computing (e.g. See Dfinity) and decentralized storage (e.g. see Dfinity and Filecoin).</p><p>Hardware of course needs a software backend to speak to, there needs to be software that facilitates computing, and the storage of data, files and assets in decentralized storage databases.

We have built an open source App called <a href=\"https://github.com/functionland/photos\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">&#x2018;photos&#x2019;</a>, that we think exemplifies the ease of developing and deploying DApps with methods already familiar to Dev&#x2019;s.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1054/1*hkdxSfQFJb_agNJLX_OYzQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Where does Functionland Fit within the Open Metaverse OS?\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Fig 1.

Will Open source developers be properly compensated for their contributions to solving networking challenges, client software distribution problems or developing incredible DApps? Can regular people transfer, store and view their own photos and documents in a secure, private way in their own homes, that is amenable to future computing paradigms (Forever photos anyone)? Can the average person become involved in crypto mining?
